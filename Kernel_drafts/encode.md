# Encode

Define a set of values, encode them as qubits, modify them and verify that you can read the correct results back.

## Definition

Define $N$ complex numbers.

$$ Cval[k] = e^{/frac{4k i \pi}{N}} $$

Load these onto the quantum computer as a set of $N$ qubits
values

Define the operation carried out by this kernel in sufficient detail to support its implementation in code.

## System features exposed

What are the system features or performance bottlenecks exposed by this kernel.

## Input data generation

describe the data used in this kernel and how it is generated.

## Output and Correctness

What is the output from this kernel and how will this output be validated

## Discussion

Describe the rationale for this kernel both in terms of the system features it exposes but also the relevance it holds for applications.
