# Dynamic Lifting

Read a qubit or qubits from a quantum computer. Compute some continuation classically while maintaining the state of existing qubits. Resume control on the quantum device.

## Definition


## System features exposed

Stresses the ability to exchange classical and quantum control while maintaining quantum states.

## Input data generation


## Output and Correctness


## Discussion

This is the most basic need of a practical quantum computer; the ability to describe an input state on the classical computer and then encode the corresponding qubits on the quantum computer.  We need a symmetrical relation, that is, we need to encode the qubits (move them from the classical computer to the quantum computer) and the opposite (move them from the quantum computer to the classical computer).
