# Universality

Given a unitary matrix and and an $\epsilon$, approximate (via the diamond norm?) the unitary to within $\epsilon$ .

## Definition


## System features exposed

Shows whether the machine can implement universal quantum computation.

## Input data generation

Specify a $2^n \times 2^n$ matrix for $n \leq 3$?

## Output and Correctness

How do we test this? Quantum state tomography?

## Discussion

In progress.
